We must unearth those talents that are hidden in houses. We don t want those talents to go to waste. The youth have to showcase their talents and be featured in newspapers and television, Coetzee said.Mayor Maudu Phokane remained proud of the abundance of talent in the area which the entity was helping to nurture. It is our responsibility to ensure that we provide the youth with resources to nurture their talents. People often indicate that we are we are a municipality with many mines and potential for growth, and therefore we should provide the youth with necessary skills and jobs. We are here today to ensure that all hidden talents are exposed. I am here to witness the beauty pageant and talents that have been discovered by our institution. The youth must direct the municipality on how to do things. They need to feel that they are important, Phokoane said.
