ROBINSON NQOLANEIGHBOURS of the man alleged to have plotted the killing President Jacob Zuma and other prominent South Africans said it was inconceivable that Elvis Ramosebudi would conspire to kill someone, let alone the president. Ramosebudi, dubbed the coup plotter , was provisionally charged with conspiracy to murder Zuma, some members of the Gupta family and other high-profile politicians including Cabinet ministers.The family of the 33-year-old man from Soshanguve Township in Tshwane appeared relaxed on Monday ahead of Tuesday s court hearing.They said they would not be talking to the media at this stage, pending the court outcome of his bail application.One of the people in the neighbourhood who preferred to remain anonymous said Ramosebudi was harmless. This is unbelievable! Elvis would never even harm a fly, she said.She said she had known the suspect for more than 15-years and it has never occurred to her that Ramosebudi would conspire to kill anyone, let alone the president. Ramosebudi appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court on Friday after the Hawks arrested him on Wednesday in Midrand.The elite crime fighting unit had described Ramosebudi as a man capable of carrying out a plot with the assistance of co-plotters.He was described as the founder of the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance.A Facebook page by the name of @Elvis Mosebodi is suspected to have been was created in support of the man.One of the people who is a member of the page and is from the same neighbourhood said the charges leveled against Ramosebudi were outrageous. The Hawks are failing to do their job and they want to abuse their power on a man who has never done anything wrong. She said they were planning on organising themselves as friends and supporters to go to court on Tuesday but were afraid that they could be perceived as members of the Anti-State Capture Death Squad. We cannot do much to show support to Elvis because the hawks might think that we support the crime that he s alleged to have committed. We had planned on going to court as a group of supporters but we do not want to be arrested too, she said.Last week, the court heard that the coup plotter had written to businessman and philanthropist Nicky Oppenheimer and asked for donations amounting to millions of rands to carry out his plot.Ramosebudi allegedly shared his personal bank and residential address information with his potential donors.
