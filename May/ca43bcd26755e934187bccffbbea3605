Photo: Matome Sebelemetsa&nbsp;The school is said to owe the power utility R105 000. The parents accused the school of lying about the real reasons why the school was in the dark.&#8220;They told us that criminals stole cables and the department of education is nowhere to be found. This is totally unacceptable. How do you explain or justify allowing disabled children to bath with cold water in winter, let alone the unsafe environment in the hostels and the entire premises?,&#8221; said one of the parents who declined to be named. &#8220;We came as far as Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Polokwane to take our children because we did not want them to experience what occurred to the Johannesburg children.&#8221;Eastes refused to comment on the matter and referred inquiries to the School Governing Body (SGB).Attempts to reach SGB Chairperson Raymond Mabuza were not successful.
