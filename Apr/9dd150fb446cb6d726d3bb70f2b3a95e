However, he is finding it difficult to take his career to the next level because of lack of sponsorship. The challenges that I am currently facing are lack of sponsors, supplements and money to go to racing events as I am currently unemployed, said Rutendo, who now relies on the sport for survival after dropping out of Grade 11 in 2012.Polokwane executive mayor Thembi Nkadimeng told African Times that the event was aimed at empowering amateur athletes in the province. This fun race aims to encourage people who are not actually professionals to be involved in sport despite their age and disability,&#8221; she said.
