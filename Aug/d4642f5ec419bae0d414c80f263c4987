The members boycotted Tuesday&#8217;s sitting stating that they no longer had faith in Khoza for breaching the ANC&#8217;s constitution.Mhlauli said Khoza s continued public attacks have led to her alienating ANC members of parliament including those in her committee resulting in an ill-advised and out-of-line decision to boycott any activity she is involved in.&#8220;The erosion of trust in her as a chairperson has also led to acrimonious verbal exchanges between her and members of the study group in meetings and on social media. The decision to relieve her as chairperson comes after numerous failed attempts by the leadership of the organisation to counsel her on her behaviour,&#8221; said Mhlauli.She added that the was communicated to Khoza and she has been released from her position of chairperson with immediate effect. She will, however, continue being an MP pending her disciplinary hearing that has been set for September.Outspoken: ANC MP Dr Makhosi Khoza in Parliament&#8220;She remains an ANC member of parliament pending the outcomes of disciplinary action taken against her by the organisation. The entire ANC component of the committee will also be reconfigured with the view of strengthening the work of this committee,&#8221; she said.Mhlauli also added that disciplinary process against those members of the study group who boycotted the portfolio committee meeting on Tuesday 15 August was already underway.
