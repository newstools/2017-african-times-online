As a family we want to also find the body of my daughter and bury her in dignity&#8221; said Nkentjane.The court heard that Nkentjane had gone with Maziya, the toddler s uncle to the bushes at Mgobodzi village, south of Malalane two years ago.However, Maziya came back and informed the child s parents that she went missing in the bushes.After being assaulted by community members, Maziya allegedly confessed that he had sold the child to a sangoma and some pastors.The trial continues.
