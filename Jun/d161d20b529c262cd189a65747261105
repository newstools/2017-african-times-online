Police Minister Fikile Mbalula contacted Nel-Peters after hearing about the incident.He said police were at the crime scene and conducting interviews and scene investigations.Mbalula said he viewed all crimes against women as an added priority.He said the might of the law will deal with the three men and all criminals who are hell bent to make South Africans prisoners of fear.&#8220;No resources will be spared in the fight against crime. Enough is Enough was two decades ago, now is the time to take the war against crime direct to these enemies of the people, it should be made a societal shame when armed men point deadly weapons at females, these cowards are called amagwala. Each father, brother, uncle must realize that each crime against a female could be a crime against a sister, mother or aunt. Men must protect their women folk and not turn them into prey,&#8221; said Mbalula.
