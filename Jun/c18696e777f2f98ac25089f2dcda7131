MASOKA DUBE and CHESTER MAKANAA PROMINENT Limpopo lawyer is wanted by the police in connection with the shooting of four farm workers at Zebediela outside Mokopane on Thursday morning.Tumi Mokwena, former EFF leader Julius Malema s lawyer, allegedly shot four of his employees at the Zebediela Citrus Farm before fleeing the scene.Limpopo police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident and called on Mokwena to hand himself over to the Zebediela police.WANTED: Police have launched a man-hunt for prominent lawyer Tumi Mokwena.The shooting incident comes after months of squabbles between Mokwena and some of the beneficiaries of the R60 million citrus estate over shareholding, directorship and wages.Members of the Bjatladi Community Property Association (CPA) &#8211; the beneficiaries of a land claim &#8211; had accused Mokwena, their lawyer, of having hijacked their estate and appointed himself as a director without their knowledge.During its heydays, in the late 1990&#8217;s Zebediela was one the biggest producers and exporters of oranges in the country.Sources told African Times that the incident was preceded by a heated meeting between Mokwena and Bjatladi community members over wages and ownership. When Mokwena became the owner of the farm some time ago, he needed favours from some of the employees, whom he skyrocketed their salaries from R3000, some from R6000 to R60 000 a month. So, when the new partners came in, they decided to cut down the salaries of Mokwena s friends, said one of the sources. So, this morning Mokwena went to the farm to solve his friends salary problems, then some employees who were always not happy with him, spotted him and started to protest and chased him away. He then pulled out a gun, shot them and sped off. Ngoepe said the victims have been admitted to the Lebowakgomo Hospital with serious gunshot injuries.One of them was in critical condition, he added. African Times and other media organisations were denied access to the hospital on Thursday.RATTLED: Bjatladi Community Property Association members enter Zebediela Citrus Farm after the shooting incident.
