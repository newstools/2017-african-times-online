KARABO NGOEPETHE mayor of Mogale City in Gauteng Michael Holenstein has been unseated from his position following a motion of no confidence in his abilities.The ANC tabled the motion and emerged victorious with 39 votes as compared to the 38 he got. ANC West Rand deputy chairperson Mzi Khumalo said they tabled the motion because Holenstein presented a budget that was not endorsed by council to communities.&#8220;The ANC placed a motion of no confidence on the basis of gross violation of the laws governing local government by the executive mayor. These include taking to communities an IDP/Budget for 2017/2018 without it being endorsed by Council; political interference in administration as well as landing the municipality in serious financial dire straits through reckless decision-making amongst other things,&#8221; he said.FIRED: Mogale City mayor Michael Holenstein was voted out following a motion of no confidence (Picture: Supplied)She was replaced by Holenstein who was subsequently voted out on Wednesday on accusations leading the municipality in the wrong direction.Mogale City is among the four municipalities in Gauteng under the control of the DA. The others are Tshwane, Johannesburg and Midvaal.Khumalo said they had to act swiftly and decisively to avoid the municipality falling under administration on the grounds of the numerous violations.&#8220;Unfortunately, for the people of Mogale City, this is the second time that a DA/EFF mayor has been removed from this seat since August 2016. We had maintained consistently that the DA/EFF coalition was collapsing the municipality through sheer incompetence and decline of service delivery since the coalition took over the city. The ANC is of the view that the municipality deserves a responsible, transparent, honest and accountable executive mayor who puts the interests of the community of Mogale City first and not narrow selfish interests,&#8221; he said.
