MOGAU PHALATHE South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has urged the department of transport in Limpopo to speed up the issuing of vehicle permits.Hundreds of taxi operators took to the streets of Polokwane on Thursday and marched to the department to the department of transport deliver a memorandum calling for a speedy resolution to the problems they face. Santaco chairperson in the Capricorn region Solly Ledwaba accused the department of not keeping its word of promising to issue the permits. He said the promise was made in 2012 but nothing had since materialised. Operators have since filled the required application forms dating back to 2013 and those forms are gathering dust in your department. Fulfil the promises of your predecessor. If not, 2019 will not be business as usual. We are sick and tired of being taken for a ride, Ledwaba said.Act now: Taxi operators call for speed in the issuing of operating permitsHe said he did not understand why it took the department so long to process the applications. He added that their failures were causing problems for operators and drivers on the road who have to deal with law enforcement officers. It takes the department forever to process applications for additional authorities and that exposes the taxi industry to the law enforcement and that is not acceptable. We demand speedy feedback on all applications he added.Ledwaba also accused the government of using the impounding of their vehicles as a cash making mechanism. He further claimed that they were not consulted when the prices paid to get their cars after being impounded were increased. We demand that the impoundment fee be reviewed, it cannot be correct to turn our business into your milking cow, he said.The organisation gave MEC Nandi Ndalane 14 days to respond to the memorandum. She promised to have a response within the set deadline. She further added that issues affecting the provincial taxi industry would be dealt with during a planned taxi indaba.
