We need to cleanse ourselves on these negative tendencies that have crept in over the years,&#8221; he said.In an unprecedented move triggered by divisions within the party, the 2017 ANC Policy Conference is scheduled to last over a period of five days.Some of the key issues discussed will look at Radical Economic Transformation as well as Land Expropriation Without Compensation.Highlighting some of the gains that have been made in recent years, Zuma said the party prides itself on the growth of the middle class, and through its Black Economic Empowerment policy, the aim will be to broaden the policy which will enable it to reach more people within the next five years.He added that the conference needs to reflect on the pace of the implementation of ANC programmes. One of these is to ensure that the youth gains access to better economic opportunities through the provision of quality, free and affordable education.&#8220;In 2007, we resolved that free higher education for the poor up to undergraduate level must be made possible. Everyone has the right to a basic education which, through reasonable measures must be made accessible,&#8221; said Zuma.
